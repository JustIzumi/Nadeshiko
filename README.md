## Setup

If you would like to download the source code, then you can do that using git:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/szyven/Nadeshiko.git
```

After downloading the source code, install all the needed packages using NPM, then create a `.env` file (the following will store our token, api keys and all the important stuff).
(You can find a pattern for your `.env` file in `.env.example`)

If you're done with the setup, run the bot by running `launcher.cmd` (found in the `src` folder)

That is it!
