# Setup
**We're going to go step by step on how to set up the project on your machine!**
_**Let's start**_

## 1. Clone the repository
*Make sure `git` is installed locally on your system! If, it isn't, then you can install it **[here](https://git-scm.com/downloads)***

You can easily clone the repository using git's `clone` command!
Open up a command prompt window and run this command in the drive or folder you want to clone the repository into:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/szyven/nadeshiko.git
```

## 2. Install other required dependencies/programs

- **NodeJS** - Make sure NodeJS is installed! (I recommend using `v.12.8.1` or higher)
- **TypeScript (`TSC`)** - Make sure that the TypeScript compiler is installed!

*If the TypeScript compiler is not installed, then you can do that by running `node i -g typescript`!*

## 3. Create environmental variables (`.env`)

Create a `.env` file in your root folder, and fill it in accoding to the template you can find in the file `.env.example`

## 4. Install all dependencies

Just open up `launcher.cmd` and then choose option `3`

*Or you can just run `npm i -save` in your project folder*

## 5. Start the bot
This step is the easiest

Just open up the `launcher.cmd` file, and type in `1` or `2` when it asks you to choose an option!
That's it!
